This is a simple project consisting of a TODO app.  
Implemented features:
- user authentication
- CRUD operations over todos
- automatic redirect in case of unauthorised access
- a configurated Firebase app which backs data
- Tailwind for instant style rules
- [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/)

## The project under the hood
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.
